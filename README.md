# aespresso
A Gtk3 frontend for archlinux's archlinux-java script.

### Installation:

The AUR package is here: [aespresso](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aespresso/)

### Running:

Use the application menu. Wait, sorry you're an Arch user so you probably don't use those. ; )

For my Arch comrades faster with a terminal than an application menu: `aespresso`
